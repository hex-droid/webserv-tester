Ignore or reject message with whitespace between the start-line and the first
header field.

Recipients of an invalid request-line SHOULD respond with either a 400 error or 301 redirect
with the request-target properly encoded.

It is RECOMMENDED that all HTTP senders and recipients support, at a minimum, request-line
lengths of 8000 bytes.

No whitespace is allowed between the header field-name and colon.

The presence of a message body in a request in signaled by a Content-Length or
Transfer-Encoding header field. Request message framing is independent of method
semantics, even if the method does not define any use for a message body.

A sender MUST NOT apply chunked more than once to a message body.

Header fields that specifically descrive the payload, rather than the associated
representation, are referred to as "payload header fields".

A user agent SHOULD NOT send a Content-Length header field when the request message does
not contain a payload body and the method semantics do not anticipate such a body.

Any Content-Length field value greater than of equal to zero is valid.
